# Markdown Reflections <br>

I experienced some difficulties with GitHub with creating branches and being unable to push successfully after deploying the final app. This led me to creating a new repo with a slightly different name: datasci_4_web_viz_1.

## Shiny R <br>

### <u>Thoughts</u> <br>

<b>The posit.cloud and R style were very different formats than what I've gotten used to, however, after additional reading, was able to understand a little more.
The popup message when packages needed to be installed was helpful.</b> <br>

<p>Challenge: Difficulty navigating the Workspaces within the posit Cloud<br>
Solution: Figured out the workspaces and app deployments by web-searching</p> <br>

<p>Challenge: Difficulty connecting raw data to R app<br>
Solution: Modeled example of using github https link as raw data</p> <br>

<p>Challenge: Difficulty connecting shinyapps.io<br>
Solution: Connected succesfully after web-searching</p> <br>

<p>Challenge: Difficulty connecting website to the server<br>
Solution: Data source from github had changed, which stopped the website from loading. Fixed data source and reloaded website. <br>

## Shiny Python <br>

### <u>Thoughts</u> <br>

<b>Using Shiny Python had added complexity with the requirements.txt file and using rsconnect. The .py file familiarity was welcomed, and the code a little easier to understand.</b> <br>

<p>Challenge: Difficulty deploying shiny python to shinyapps.io due to improperly configured Requirements.txt<br>
Solution: Resolved by adding in matplotlib</p> <br>

<p>Challenge: Difficulty deploying shiny python to shinyapps.io using rsconnect<br>
Solution: Using a web search, found an alternate command for rsconnect that allowed the app to connect to shinyapps.io</p> <br>

## Flask <br>

### <u>Thoughts</u> <br>

<b>Using python's flask was the most error-free step, as I had some famliarity with using flask from a previous assignment.</b> <br> 

<p>Challenge: Difficulty running app due to index.html file not being configured properly<br>
Solution: After a web search, renamed index.html, created templates folder, and added under the python_flask folder</p> <br>
